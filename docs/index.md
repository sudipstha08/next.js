<Link> is a built-in component that extends the HTML <a> tag to provide prefetching and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary and recommended way to navigate between routes in Next.js.

The useRouter hook allows you to programmatically change routes from Client Components.It does not create a <a> tag, which means - if you are concern with SEO, your links will not be detected by crawlers.

```
Recommendation: Use the <Link> component to navigate between routes unless you have a specific requirement for using useRouter.
