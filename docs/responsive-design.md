- Media query:
  CSS3 feature that makes a webpage adapt its layout to different screen sizes and media types.

```css
  @media media type and (condition: breakpoint) {
  // CSS rules
  }
```
  If we don’t apply a media type, the @ media rule selects all types of devices by default. Otherwise, Media types come right after the @ media rule.

- Common breakpoints
```
  320px — 480px: Mobile devices
  481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets
  769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops
  1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens
  1201px and more: Extra large screens, TV
```
